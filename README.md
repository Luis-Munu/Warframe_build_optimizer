# Warframe_build_optimizer
A WIP optimizer for frame builds in the game WARFRAME. Uses a combination of algorithms in order to find builds with the desired stats.

The user can:
- Set its own polarities in the build.
- Restrict mod slots, aura, exilus and standard.
- Set a custom capacity limit.
- Set custom base stats (if using archon shards or specific frames such as Nidus)

Lots of things to be done:
- Refactor the code.
- Remove duplicate code.
- Try to enhance the greedy algorithm mod selection on each step.
- Add a GUI.
- Load warframe stats directly from the wwdc github.
